The Visual Timeline is a new component on Getty object pages that visualizes important events in the life of a work of art. The timeline gathers and organizes dates found in other parts of the object page into a simple, elegant graphic presentation. The Visual Timeline presents an opportunity to feature the object’s history—it’s story through time—as a vital dimension of the work of art.


## Background

Collection objects are time travelers. Works of art connect audiences to the time the object was created, and to a sequence of events that make up the history of the object.

Along with caring for objects’ physical well-being, museums also care for objects’ stories. While the physical object provides a powerful in-person experience, the object’s stories provide vital context for the work of art. They connect us to other people, places and perspectives; they tell us why the object was important and suggest why it matters now.

Getty is known for its care in attending to the life story of an object. Meticulous provenance research, for instance, tells an important story of how an object moves from one person to another over time. Getty is a model for museums in how it values provenance, provides for provenance research, and encourages collaboration and sharing around provenance data. It is also a leader in the quality and structure of its object data.

We saw an opportunity to showcase Getty’s interest in the story of an object over time. Much of the object page focuses on the current physicality of the object—how it looks, its dimensions, where it’s exhibited, its material makeup—how might we bring attention to the object’s history, from the moment of its creation to now? Much of the time-based data is textual, and scattered in lists around the page; what if we brought it together, and made it visual? 


## Prior Art

There are few examples of timelines in the context of an object page. Cooper Hewitt took a whimsical approach with its [emoji timeline](https://labs.cooperhewitt.org/2015/the-emoji-timeline/), which presented key moments from the object  page on a timeline using symbols (a camera symbol for digitization date, for instance.) Cooper Hewitt also developed a more elegant [experimental timeline](https://labs.cooperhewitt.org/2013/a-timeline-of-event-horizons/) feature. NYPL takes a very simple approach—colored diamonds on a line—with its [digital collections pages](https://digitalcollections.nypl.org/items/510d47dd-e820-a3d9-e040-e00a18064a99). [Art Tracks](https://www.slideshare.net/workergnome/21st-century-provenance-lessons-learned-building-art-tracks) used timelines to visualize object-level provenance. Collection-level timelines are somewhat  more common (Met, Prado, Digital Museum, Photogrammar, see also Olivia Vane’s [Timeline design for visualising cultural heritage data](http://researchonline.rca.ac.uk/4325/1/TimelineDesignForVisualisingCulturalHeritageData_OliviaVane_redacted.pdf) ).


## Experience

The visual timeline appears as a slim graphic visualization when the object page loads. A blue line traces the path of the object through time; even at this high level, the line might give the sense of a smooth journey or a busy, storied life. A click opens a fullscreen, detailed view. Time flows from top (creation date) to bottom (today). The line flows from left to right as the object changes hands, from the maker, through individual owners, and finally to Getty. Two buttons and a slider at the bottom allow you to move forward and backward. (Arrow keys will also work.) In this fullscreen view, white lines overlaid on the blue path provide additional detail, and solid white labels mark exhibitions.

The visual timeline complements the provenance and exhibition data on the object page. The text panels deliver detail and nuance; they’re scannable and express sequential dates well. The visual presentation excels at suggesting trends, durations, gaps and clusters of activity. Importantly, the timeline also works to visualize uncertainty: placeholder columns show gaps in the provenance record, and the line fades where dates are fuzzy. 

If there is room for the whimsical or poetic in an object page, perhaps it’s here: where a blue ribbon traces the path of a work of art through time, as it’s passed down and changes hands, and circulates in culture and history.
