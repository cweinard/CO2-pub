Most museum mission statements include notions of education, inspiration and preservation of collections. Online collections are foundational infrastructure to execute those museum mission statements today. 

## Digital cultural objects

Objects circulate within contemporary cultural spaces that are both digital and physical. A museum object that first made an impact on the small group of devotees who came to see it in person, and later became known through copies and prints, then books and photography, now courses through digital networks, connecting with other objects and people, with unparalleled speed and reach. The online collection is the museum’s interface to that world wide web—providing an authoritative, stable reference for images and context, and supporting the use of museum collections in contemporary conversation, to connect, inspire and educate. Online collections allow objects—and institutions—newfound relevance. The physical experience of objects is no less important, but now the potential impact is on a different scale.

## Internal resource

Nearly every department in a collecting museum benefits from ready, open access to collection information and images—from docents and educators to marketing, communications, development, visitor services, programs, not to mention exhibitions, conservation and curatorial. In most cases, accessing collections directly through the proprietary collections management system is cumbersome at best, and often expensive; online collections are easier for staff to access and search.

## Collections care

Caring for the physical well-being of an object is a monumental task, but it’s not enough. Museums need to cultivate, conserve and share the knowledge, connections and stories that give an object meaning and value. Digital systems are the best way to manage collections context, and online collections are key to sharing it.

 ## Engagement

Caring _for_ collections requires cultivating communities that care _about_ collections. While a passionate curator might be able to support a collection on their own in the short term, it takes support by communities and societies to preserve cultural heritage for the long term. An online collection equips a museum to deliver timely, relevant, useful moments of engagement that help audiences care about collections.

 ## Scholarship

Online collections bring museums into a worldwide scholarly community. (All scholarship today is digital scholarship.) Online collections are a space to share the museum’s own research, as well as that of other scholars. Moreover, online collections provide the building blocks for new scholarship: object pages provide images, context, and act as stable referents as objects circulate in networked conversation. Sharing collection information widely, and inviting feedback, is a great way to refine that information. Online collections even allow museums to suggest what is _not_ known and so direct where further research might be fruitful.

 ## Interpretation

With a robust online collection in place, creative interpretive projects are free to explore timely themes and focus on specific audiences. An interactive treasure hunt through Classical sculpture for K-5 classes need not include deep object information, for instance; a new modern photography program can focus on its audience, and offer links to collection pages for those who are interested in deeper information. Dreaming of an experimental browser-based collection visualization? Consider linking to object pages for extended info; no need to duplicate concerns. Having deep context readily available for an object opens up interpretive possibilities.

Having an online collection allows a digital team to build experimental interfaces (tailored for specific audiences and uses), and link to object pages for detailed information.

 ## Education

Collection objects support object-based teaching and learning in a range of subjects. This learning can happen in-person in the galleries, but it can also happen in the classroom, or at home, or both. (Indeed, it’s amazing when it happens just before a visit, or soon after.) Using an online collection, teachers and learners can browse from a wide array of museum objects. (This exploration can be inspiring in itself.) Then they can select just the right works of art—which come with high-resolution images, contextual information, and often with interpretive materials as well. In addition to this self-service mode, teachers and learners can also benefit from collection-focused lesson plans and activities that provide examples of particularly engaging objects and activities.
