The new resource features rich object pages that aim for a comprehensive view of all that Getty knows about an object, including audio, video, publications, provenance and more. The site offers new gallery pages, exhibition pages and people pages that connect and contextualize works of art. The fresh, clean, responsive design extends the new component-based design system that has revitalized Getty.edu.\nThis digital publication aims to share some of the thinking that went into Getty’s re-imagined collection online. Written as a series of articles, the publication will explore specific topics by looking broadly across the sector, and then diving into the specifics of Getty’s own implementation.\nGetty Digital is eager to share what it’s learned in the process of building the new collection online. Although this publication marks just a snapshot in time, and doesn’t aspire to be a comprehensive survey, we do hope that it sparks ongoing conversation in the field. Feedback is welcome.\n","id":0,"length":182,"title":"Cover","type":"cover","url":"/"},{"content":"Most museum mission statements include notions of education, inspiration and preservation of collections. Online collections are foundational infrastructure to execute those museum mission statements today.\nDigital cultural objects Objects circulate within contemporary cultural spaces that are both digital and physical. A museum object that first made an impact on the small group of devotees who came to see it in person, and later became known through copies and prints, then books and photography, now courses through digital networks, connecting with other objects and people, with unparalleled speed and reach. The online collection is the museum’s interface to that world wide web—providing an authoritative, stable reference for images and context, and supporting the use of museum collections in contemporary conversation, to connect, inspire and educate. Online collections allow objects—and institutions—newfound relevance. The physical experience of objects is no less important, but now the potential impact is on a different scale.\nEven when safely tucked away in storage, a museum object can be alive and active in cultural spaces.  Internal resource Nearly every department in a collecting museum benefits from ready, open access to collection information and images—from docents and educators to marketing, communications, development, visitor services, programs, not to mention exhibitions, conservation and curatorial. In most cases, accessing collections directly through the proprietary collections management system is cumbersome at best, and often expensive; online collections are easier for staff to access and search.\nEven institutions 100% focused on the in-person experience benefit from digital systems that help them craft and share that experience.  Collections care Caring for the physical well-being of an object is a monumental task, but it’s not enough. Museums need to cultivate, conserve and share the knowledge, connections and stories that give an object meaning and value. Digital systems are the best way to manage collections context, and online collections are key to sharing it.\nWithout its context, a museum object is no different than a flea market find.  Engagement Caring for collections requires cultivating communities that care about collections. While a passionate curator might be able to support a collection on their own in the short term, it takes support by communities and societies to preserve cultural heritage for the long term. An online collection equips a museum to deliver timely, relevant, useful moments of engagement that help audiences care about collections.\nWhen the whole collection is at their fingertips, a museum social media manager can weave collection objects into community conversations.  Scholarship Online collections bring museums into a worldwide scholarly community. (All scholarship today is digital scholarship.) Online collections are a space to share the museum’s own research, as well as that of other scholars. Moreover, online collections provide the building blocks for new scholarship: object pages provide images, context, and act as stable referents as objects circulate in networked conversation. Sharing collection information widely, and inviting feedback, is a great way to refine that information. Online collections even allow museums to suggest what is not known and so direct where further research might be fruitful.\nThe online collection is not a dusty publication, but rather an active, current, dynamic scholarly resource.  Interpretation With a robust online collection in place, creative interpretive projects are free to explore timely themes and focus on specific audiences. An interactive treasure hunt through Classical sculpture for K-5 classes need not include deep object information, for instance; a new modern photography program can focus on its audience, and offer links to collection pages for those who are interested in deeper information. Dreaming of an experimental browser-based collection visualization? Consider linking to object pages for extended info; no need to duplicate concerns. Having deep context readily available for an object opens up interpretive possibilities.\nHaving an online collection allows a digital team to build experimental interfaces (tailored for specific audiences and uses), and link to object pages for detailed information.  Education Collection objects support object-based teaching and learning in a range of subjects. This learning can happen in-person in the galleries, but it can also happen in the classroom, or at home, or both. (Indeed, it’s amazing when it happens just before a visit, or soon after.) Using an online collection, teachers and learners can browse from a wide array of museum objects. (This exploration can be inspiring in itself.) Then they can select just the right works of art—which come with high-resolution images, contextual information, and often with interpretive materials as well. In addition to this self-service mode, teachers and learners can also benefit from collection-focused lesson plans and activities that provide examples of particularly engaging objects and activities.\nOnline collections are a fundamental infrastructure for object-based teaching and learning today.

Moreover, they address a person’s need; online collections have a job to do.\nThese are bland, broad truisms, hardly worth saying. And yet, too often museum products are built to serve institutional goals rather than audience needs. Even broad consideration for audiences—for people—and what might help and delight them, can inform project direction.\nGetty’s new collection online focuses on two broad audiences: researchers and enthusiasts.\nResearchers Researchers are the primary audience for Getty. These are users who come to the museum website with a specific purpose, needing answers to a specific question. They’ll know to look in the main navigation for a link to the collection. Internal audiences—museum staff needing quick access to collection info—fit neatly into this user group as well. (In many museums, staff prefer searching the public-facing online collection because accessing the internal collections management system is too tedious.) Researchers arrive to the collection online with a good idea of what they are looking for, and they know which search terms might get them what they want. They need little scaffolding or context around the collections as a whole.\nResearchers’ experience paths Goal: Researchers are looking for specific information on a specific object in order to complete their research.\n Arrive at an object page via collection search, Google search, or direct link. Find object page with deep information, including the full scope of Getty’s institutional knowledge perhaps comment/respond, download image/data, find related objects (by artist, creation date, etc.).  Enthusiasts Enthusiasts have a different set of requirements. These are users who aren’t looking for a specific work of art using specialized art knowledge. That’s not to say that the enthusiast doesn’t have a specific question or purpose; it’s just that they’ll know an answer or solution when they see it. For the enthusiast, searching by keyword isn’t the best approach; search terms for visual features, or ideas, or themes, rarely work. A search box alone, in fact, can be a roadblock to the enthusiast. A dominant search box allows entry only to those who know a magic word, a search incantation. This is the dynamic described by Mitchell Whitelaw in his influential essay “generous interfaces.” When required to produce a magic word to open the collection, many a clever enthusiast will game the system by typing the first word that comes to mind, just to start looking. Visual browsing is the primary mode for the enthusiast; they’re eager to see a field of images and start searching and finding.\nEnthusiasts’ experience paths Goal: Enthusiasts are looking for interesting, non-specific objects or images for enjoyment and inspiration.\n Arrive at an object page via an interpretive layer, social media, Google image search, or visual browse. Skim images and information Perhaps download image, save/share Continue browsing via path of interesting-ness, related objects (by color, visual similarity, etc), interpretive materials, etc.  Why is a scholarly audience the primary audience? Optimizing object pages for a scholarly audience can be the best approach for enthusiast audiences as well.\nObject pages act as terminal nodes in a knowledge graph: there is no deeper level of information for an individual object. Object pages offer a complete record of institutional knowledge around an object at a stable url. This deep level of information is appropriate for scholarly audiences.\nWith their deep information, object pages provide a supportive foundation for interpretive layers that cater to enthusiasts and other audiences. Deep object pages allow other interpretive expressions of the collection—like visualizations, exhibition pages, online publications and games—to be nimble and tailored to a particular purpose and audience. An online educational resource meant for middle school students, for instance, can focus on engaging its unique audience through storytelling and resonant connections; it can rely on links to object pages to provide deep object-based information.\nObject pages are fundamental multipurpose building blocks for interpreting the collection. They need to be useful for scholars—who use them to construct their scholarly work, and to staff—who use them to build interpretive programs. As building blocks, they are also useful to enthusiasts, students, teachers and others for use in a range of activities.\nWhile the scholarly and enthusiast audiences have different goals and requirements, both can be addressed by this thoughtful approach to the object pages. Images are a top priority for both audiences, as is basic information. The scholarly audience will want detailed information as well, along with related objects (esp. objects related to scholarship). An enthusiast audience will want related objects, interpretation, and programs (esp. interesting links that spark curiosity). The object page can accommodate a range of needs.\nHow does an object page work?   As a destination (terminal node). An object page, or a collection of object pages, supports interpretive layers that can be optimized for any audience. The interpretive program (a lesson plan, an exhibition page, or a digital publication, for instance) can link to object pages where appropriate. This relieves the interpretive program from having to provide deep information on individual objects; instead, the program can give broad context tailored for specific goals and audiences.\n  As a hub. The object page is not just an end point for interpretation or scholarship; it is also a portal for further exploration. An object page links to relevant interpretive pages and related object pages, offering opportunities to discover new connections and context.\n  What would an object page look like if it were designed for an enthusiast audience? It may not look that different, actually. A page designed for enthusiasts might put descriptive text—written for a general audience—above the fold with the large image. Images and alternative images are key for both audiences. Extended object info text may not be as important for enthusiasts—but it also wouldn’t deter them.\nA related objects section may operate a bit differently for the two audiences. For the enthusiasts, we’d want to surface “interesting” objects that would extend the discovery journey. “Relatedness” may mean something different to a scholar: less serendipity, more human curation. For scholars, we may want to surface other objects that have appeared with the object in a publication, or in an exhibition, or in a gallery installation, for instance.\nAre mobile visitors an important audience? Short answer: Yes. In the last four years, 35% of Getty’s visitors to the online collection are using mobile devices, and this number is trending upward.\nOptimizing online collections for mobile can open (or broaden) opportunities for engagement. Social sharing, email, and messaging are on-the-go activities that benefit when links lead to a responsive site.\nGoogle Analytics, tracking users Jan 2016-Dec 2020, shows that 35% of Collection Online users are on mobile devices (not desktop or tablet). The percentage of mobile users is similar whether or not the collection landing page is included in the data. The percentage of mobile users is higher for the Getty site as a whole: about 40% of visitors to the Getty website overall are on mobile devices.\nDo visitors use the online collection while in the galleries? To date, not much. 9% of in-person respondents use their own mobile device to find “information about the art” while at the museum, according to recent Getty visitor survey data (2017-2018).\nLimited use of collection online from inside the museum isn’t surprising. Encouraging such activity typically requires specific messaging, signage and prompts on labels, visitor guides, etc. (Not to mention easy-to-access wifi, charging stations, etc.)\nDynamics may be changing moving forward, however. The pandemic has pushed QR codes to the mainstream, and museum use is rising. (Scan a QR code on a gallery label for more object information.) Likewise, text recognition in mobile cameras is becoming standard. (Snap a photo of a label, select text, search Google…) The latest iPhones have a feature called Visual Lookup as part of the standard Photos app, which uses visual similarity to suggest links to object information. (Snap a photo of a painting, click a link to more information—powered by Siri Knowledge.)\nDo people want the “wikipedia rabbit hole” browsing experience, where they follow links of interest? Maybe…but it hasn’t been encouraged previously.\nIt’s hard to tell what visitors want by looking at analytics data, though we can learn a little about what they do. Google analytics shows that 60% of Collection Online visitors stay to see just one page. (That number is 70% for mobile visitors.) After the first page, there’s a drop in engagement: 12% of Collection Online users click through to see two pages. (This is a steeper drop than what we see for the site as a whole.) About 26% of Online Collection users see three or more pages. There is an opportunity to encourage more exploration. We’ve found in our sector scan that museums are experimenting with new ways to present related objects and provide links to interesting contextual information (even info found on other sites.) There’s a natural overlap here: object pages should show all available contextual materials for an object, and interesting relationships as well, in order to best situate the object. Doing so can also spark a chain of associations: a Wikipedia rabbit hole.\n","id":2,"length":1507,"title":"2. Who is it for?: Audiences for online collections","type":"essay","url":"/essay-who/"},{"content":"The collection overview is the homepage for a museum collection. When you click on “Collection” or “Search the Collection” in the main navigation of a museum website, this is where you land. On one hand, the collection overview carries the symbolic weight of the whole museum on its shoulders: if museums are defined by their collections, then this page defines the museum on the web. On the other hand, this page rarely ranks high in terms of audience use; online collections as a whole often garner significant traffic, but collection overview pages, not so much. (Most visits to collection pages come via Google and organic search, rather than through the museum website itself.) For some museums, the collection overview can be the site of a titanic power struggle between curatorial departments jockeying for recognition, or worse—an afterthought. For other museums, though, the collection overview is an opportunity to introduce a broad audience to the collection—to show what makes up the museum’s collection, to reveal what makes it unique and interesting, and to equip and inspire audiences to search, browse and explore.\nA Typology of Overviews Collection overview pages range from the very simple to full-featured and elaborate. Broadly, they fall within four distinct types:\nSearch Box A page with just a search box (and perhaps some explanatory text) is the archetypal collection overview. When collection databases were first ported onto the web, this was the access page. If you weren’t looking for something in particular, or didn’t know what terms might garner useful results, or if you didn’t know what sorts of things were in the collection, then this search box was a roadblock. Few of these remain, thankfully. (To this day, however, when staff access the collections management system internally, chances are good they’ll use a simple search page like this to do it.)\nDepartmental The departmental view is based on the curatorial departments that support the collection. The collection overview links to pages that describe each curatorial department and its collection, perhaps including information about the curators themselves. Conservation and publications may be part of the mix as well. This approach mistakes internal org structure for an appropriate audience-facing finding aid, and risks creating information silos. It directs interest in the collection toward information about internal departments, making it hard for audiences to get to the business of browsing, exploring and looking at art.\nHighlights This most popular type of collection overview features a curated selection of collection objects presented as a grid of thumbnail images. The immediate dive into visual browsing is a clear advantage here. Defining a collection by its “greatest hits,” however, risks focusing exclusively on individual “masterpieces” and perpetuating a popular status quo. (It’s no wonder that the most visited objects in the online collection are the ones on the first row.) Regularly changing the order of the curated set is one way to broaden the perspective. [Harvard Art Museums] [Art Institute of Chicago]\nStorytelling Showcasing stories about the collection—through articles, blog posts, video or audio—is a natural way to provide context for the collection. Presenting sets of collection objects using text and rich media leverages many museums’ core competency. This approach, however, requires significant editorial resources and ongoing organizational commitment, which can be hard for many museums to sustain. Further, the storytelling type risks reinforcing the museum’s authoritative perspective, adding an interpretive layer at a moment when audiences might be equipped to create their own stories with the collection. The Rijksmuseum shows a way forward here by featuring audience-created sets alongside stories developed by the museum. [V\u0026amp;A]\nComputational The computational approach uses data visualization techniques to give a sense of the collection as a whole. Maps, charts, graphs, etc. translate quantitative collection data into broad insights that can inform the process of searching and browsing. The downside, perhaps, is the reduction of a nuanced cultural collection to a quantified dashboard report. Few of this type exist in the wild. Most computational collection overviews exist as alternate interfaces, providing a pure browsing experience separate from the online collection. [WCMA, australia collection]\nThe old Getty collection overview was a Departmental page at heart. A sentence of text describing the whole collection, then a search box, followed by six image links leading to pages for Getty’s six curatorial departments. (Images linking to a recent blog post and video are a nod to a Storytelling approach.) Getting to an object page required three clicks—first to a departmental page, then to a departmental highlight in a carousel, then a link in the caption of a modal image. That’s too much. (Audiences might be forgiven for thinking the only way to get to the art was through a departmental office.) The search logs pointed to the problem as well: when “cat” and “dog” are the most popular search terms, it may be that people will enter the first word that comes to mind just to see some art. It was difficult to get to a work of art, and the page offered no broad sense of the collection as a whole. There was ample room for improvement.\nGetty’s New Overview The new collection overview sets out to re-imagine the Getty’s old collection landing page in order to improve the experience of enthusiasts and researchers alike. The page has several jobs to do:\n Provide a marquee entryway for collection search. Provide a view of what makes up the collection as-a-whole. Offer direct links to works of art.  Moreover, we wanted the page to be visual, sustainable, and on-brand. We couldn’t dedicate editorial resources to write stories about the collection, so the idea was to show, not tell. The page would need to change and adapt over time, and it would need to fit beautifully within the design language of the new Getty site.\nThe prominent search remains a necessity for Getty’s research community, and it’s placed at the top of the page in the new design. A row of quick suggested searches have been added as a welcome mat for enthusiasts to enter through the search box. These suggested searches will be changed over time (perhaps to reflect a holiday season, or a current news event, or an exhibition theme). Even search can be made more approachable.\nBelow the search box, a new dynamic visualization provides a view of the collection as a whole. The component takes the form of a simple bar chart, with cropped images representing categories of objects in the collection. The bold colors of the Getty palette overlay the images to indicate the proportions of each category. The default view shows Getty’s collection by era: it’s clear antiquities make up a large part of the collection, along with modern and contemporary works of art. Creation date is just one way to look at the collection, however. A row of tabs offer other perspectives on the collection, like “Department” (Getty’s well-known paintings make up a small percentage of the collection; photographs abound), and “Image use” (most objects have open access images.) The visualization provides high-level perspectives on the collection as a whole, through images and color.\nThe visualization’s interaction design is straightforward. Hovering over a column (on wider screens) reveals the representative image beneath, along with basic information about the object. A click leads to appropriate search returns, or directly to the object page for the item. The idea is to get people looking at art as quickly as possible. The visualization isn’t meant to provide a new way to browse, or to create an alternate interface for exploration. Much like a magazine cover, or a visitor center at a park, the visualization gives an appealing overview of what’s inside, tailored for interested enthusiasts—then it sends you on your way to explore.\nThe visualization is built to be a flexible and sustainable component of the Getty site. The content for the visualization—all the data for tabs, categories, colors, text labels, percentages, images, image crops, etc.—is drawn from a single text file (JSON). New tabs, showcasing new dimensions and new perspectives on the collection, can be added in time. The raw collection data is updated manually for the time being, though Getty’s infrastructure would allow even the most arcane collection queries could be automated, if need be. The image crops are delivered via IIIF, which Getty already uses throughout the collection online. The visual design is a natural extension of the modular design system developed for Getty.edu.\nCollection Overview marks the beginnings of a new approach, and a new perspective. While the old site introduced the collection by way of institutional departments, this new overview sees the collection as a whole, from multiple perspectives. In many ways it’s a production example of a generous interface: it shows rather than tells; it provides samples; shows relationships (in the categories), and provides clues (in the suggestive crops and veils.) Perhaps most importantly, though, it signals a shift from an institutional to an audience-focused approach that seeks to open the collection and get people exploring.\n","id":3,"length":1494,"title":"3. Collection Overview: Showing the big picture","type":"essay","url":"/essay-overview/"},{"content":"The Visual Timeline is a new component on Getty object pages that visualizes important events in the life of a work of art. The timeline gathers and organizes dates found in other parts of the object page into a simple, elegant graphic presentation. The Visual Timeline presents an opportunity to feature the object’s history—it’s story through time—as a vital dimension of the work of art.\nBackground Collection objects are time travelers. Works of art connect audiences to the time the object was created, and to a sequence of events that make up the history of the object.\nAlong with caring for objects’ physical well-being, museums also care for objects’ stories. While the physical object provides a powerful in-person experience, the object’s stories provide vital context for the work of art. They connect us to other people, places and perspectives; they tell us why the object was important and suggest why it matters now.\nGetty is known for its care in attending to the life story of an object. Meticulous provenance research, for instance, tells an important story of how an object moves from one person to another over time. Getty is a model for museums in how it values provenance, provides for provenance research, and encourages collaboration and sharing around provenance data. It is also a leader in the quality and structure of its object data.\nWe saw an opportunity to showcase Getty’s interest in the story of an object over time. Much of the object page focuses on the current physicality of the object—how it looks, its dimensions, where it’s exhibited, its material makeup—how might we bring attention to the object’s history, from the moment of its creation to now? Much of the time-based data is textual, and scattered in lists around the page; what if we brought it together, and made it visual?\nPrior Art There are few examples of timelines in the context of an object page. Cooper Hewitt took a whimsical approach with its emoji timeline, which presented key moments from the object page on a timeline using symbols (a camera symbol for digitization date, for instance.) Cooper Hewitt also developed a more elegant experimental timeline feature. NYPL takes a very simple approach—colored diamonds on a line—with its digital collections pages. Art Tracks used timelines to visualize object-level provenance. Collection-level timelines are somewhat more common (Met, Prado, Digital Museum, Photogrammar, see also Olivia Vane’s Timeline design for visualising cultural heritage data ).\nExperience The visual timeline appears as a slim graphic visualization when the object page loads. A blue line traces the path of the object through time; even at this high level, the line might give the sense of a smooth journey or a busy, storied life. A click opens a fullscreen, detailed view. Time flows from top (creation date) to bottom (today). The line flows from left to right as the object changes hands, from the maker, through individual owners, and finally to Getty. Two buttons and a slider at the bottom allow you to move forward and backward. (Arrow keys will also work.) In this fullscreen view, white lines overlaid on the blue path provide additional detail, and solid white labels mark exhibitions.\nThe visual timeline complements the provenance and exhibition data on the object page. The text panels deliver detail and nuance; they’re scannable and express sequential dates well. The visual presentation excels at suggesting trends, durations, gaps and clusters of activity. Importantly, the timeline also works to visualize uncertainty: placeholder columns show gaps in the provenance record, and the line fades where dates are fuzzy.\nIf there is room for the whimsical or poetic in an object page, perhaps it’s here: where a blue ribbon traces the path of a work of art through time, as it’s passed down and changes hands, and circulates in culture and history.\n[visualization reveals data needs–indirect transfer]\n","id":4,"length":642,"title":"4. Visual Timeline: Showing the life of an object","type":"essay","url":"/essay-timeline/"},{"content":"The related objects section of an object page is a unique space. On a page that’s otherwise focused on diving deep into everything that’s known about a single object, it’s a moment of diversion for those who might prefer skipping across the surface of the collection. While other sections may be painstakingly exact and authoritative, the related objects component might be optimized for serendipity and interestingness.\nA related objects section makes an object page into a hub of connections. For those arriving at an object page directly from a Google search (as is the case for most visitors), the related objects component opens a door for further exploration. Even a handful of interesting thumbnail images can suggest new paths. For enthusiasts, who aren’t looking for a specific object to answer a specific question, following a chain of association may best satisfy their needs. (It may also help them formulate a specific question.) For researchers, who are searching for specific object information, encountering related objects may inspire lateral thinking, and a broader search. Related objects can transform an object page from a terminal into a hub for exploration.\nCollection objects can be related in many different ways (see running list below). Some of these connections are machine-made, others come from cataloging practice over the years, and others are made through painstaking scholarly research and curatorial practice (exhibitions, publications, etc).\nHow might collection objects be related? Two objects might share the same\u0026hellip;\n Maker Culture Creation date Accession date Place created, place depicted, place found Physical dimensions Material Classification Provenance (once owned by same constituent) Subject matter Keywords in descriptive text Exhibition  Shown in same exhibition, and shown next to each other   Gallery  On view together and shown next to each other   Publication (scholarly, but also blogs, social media, etc) Related media (audio tour) Highlights, or other themed collections Popularity (top downloads, visits, etc) Dominant color Visual similarity  Related Objects in the Wild  Brooklyn takes a simple visual approach, offering 30 square thumbnails with no titles or metadata, seemingly looking to catch the eye of an enthusiast visitor. The Met and Art Institute of Chicago offer tabbed selections with various kinds of relationships. (An earlier Met prototype was made in response to research that indicated visitors wanted to know why certain items were shown as related.) The Minneapolis Institute of Art doesn’t have a related objects section per se, instead nearly every metadata field can be clicked to open a tiny thumbnail gallery of objects related according to that field. Related objects sections can also be immersive\u0026ndash;even becoming a free-standing interpretive layer. The Royal Academy has both a section for associated works of art (with objects by the same maker) and a related objects feature that expands to full screen, showing an interactive network graph (driven by subject tags) with thumbnails as nodes. The V\u0026amp;A takes a playful approach, offering 6 thumbnails in a pinboard arrangement. Hit the shuffle button to load 6 new objects. The Barnes offers related objects based on visual similarities (in keeping with the founder Albert C. Barnes’ interest in visual ensembles, of course.)  Getty’s new related objects component, called “More from the collection,” is distinctive in its aim for serendipity and interesting-ness. The focus isn’t on filtering or narrowing, but on broadening and introducing the unexpected. These are objects you might not think to search for—like books discovered by chance on an adjacent library shelf, or images bundled together in a Picture Collection. There are ample opportunities on the object page—and in the collection online more broadly—for precise search and faceting; this is a moment for adjacency and generative juxtaposition.\nThe design is simple and straightforward. The section features six thumbnail images, justified along the bottom edge, with title and artist below. (This “shelf” configuration is a common Getty design element in desktop views.) The component falls just below the main image block and the alternate views sections; it’s strategically placed at the bottom of a visually vibrant section to give enthusiasts an inviting off-ramp before the text-heavy detail sections below. While a welcome diversion for enthusiasts, it’s important that the component isn’t a distraction for experts. The simple design is meant to work on both counts.\nThe Getty implementation leaves open the question of how the six objects are related to the object page. In other online collections, you might see tabs or labels that define the kinds of relationships in the related objects section. (The Met recently added these, and the Art Institute of Chicago has them as well.) On the Getty page, such direct connections are provided in the object details section. (Links to artist, medium, culture, etc. take you to works of art related in that way.) This is important functionality, but it’s best handled elsewhere. Relieved of such responsibility, the related objects component has the freedom to offer an element of breadth, surprise and even playfulness.\nBehind the simple visual design lies a complex algorithm crafted to generate interesting—and perhaps unlikely—juxtapositions. For each object page, the algorithm is tasked with selecting six interesting object records; each must be unique, and have an image. A number of handcrafted queries take a given object’s specific qualities—some of which aren’t displayed on the page—and combine them into searches that would be impossible in the search interface. Some examples:\n “Rank the most similar objects based on a combination of title, alternate title, and description.” “Match the color palette, creation date (within a half century), and the same material or classification.” “Match the color palette and creation date (within a half century), but from a different culture.”  Each query tries to return twelve results. The most relevant result from each query is selected (if it hasn’t already been selected by another query.) Inverse queries—those that might surface objects from different departments or classifications, etc—are given a slight preference when filling slots. One could describe the algorithm through the lens of generative art—a bespoke interesting-ness engine with a single work of art as a seed, and a set of six compelling objects as a result.\nThe plan is for the related objects component, and the algorithm behind it, to evolve over time. Each set of six selections is ephemeral; a new set is generated for each session. Two different visitors on the same page will almost certainly see two different sets. Analytics will track how often related objects are clicked in the aggregate, and can indicate just how far a chain of association might go. Even in the short time since launch, it’s clear that the related objects component is well-used. Tuning the algorithm may itself become a creative endeavor for the technical team!\nIt’s important to note that the results of algorithms can be unexpected, despite being well-crafted and well-intentioned. The Getty component was crafted to allow for serendipity and generative, even poetic, juxtaposition. With a collection as broad and diverse as Getty’s, however, there is a chance that the unexpected might be unsuitable for some audiences. This is something we’ll need to keep an eye on. The title of the section, “More from the collection” was chosen to set expectations. “You may also like” or similar would be a poor choice if inappropriate items were to appear. Also, the site doesn’t track individual users in order to feed the algorithm, so a personal address didn’t seem right.\n The feeling of fortuitous gratitude at coming across unexpected information is something most of us who’ve done any research, have experienced — that kismet of finding the perfect book, one spine away from the one that was sought.\n Sometimes the most important find is one you didn’t think to search for. Like the pivotal book you find on a nearby library shelf, the related objects section aims to set the stage for unexpected discoveries..\n","id":5,"length":1294,"title":"5. Related Objects","type":"essay","url":"/essay-related/"},{"content":"Complex objects are\u0026hellip;complicated! In museum collections, complex objects are those in which multiple objects make up a whole. (Many tea cups and a tea pot make up a tea service; multiple panels make up an altarpiece; multiple pages, each with two sides, make up a manuscript, etc.) Museums need to keep a separate record for each component, because each piece might be moved individually, and each might have its own exhibition history, etc. But all of these individual records pose a challenge for online collections, particularly in search and display. (It makes practical sense that the dozens of pottery sherds that make up a pot are each associated with the same ensemble image…but it makes displaying them together a challenge.) When faced with hundreds of pottery fragments, or dozens of manuscript pages, it’s easy to miss the forest in all the trees.\nGetty’s old collection online presented complex objects without the context they needed. It treated all records as equal, separate entities, and didn’t do a good job of connecting parts and wholes. Due to display limitations, cataloging information was sometimes duplicated across parent and child records. In some cases, part records were withheld from public view to avoid confusion. There was a lot of room for improvement.\nExamples Recent examples of online collections from Cleveland Museum of Art, Qatar Digital Library and the Walters show better ways of showcasing complex objects:\nCleveland Museum of Art Cleveland’s advanced search supports an option to “include object parts.” (See screenshot.)        Expand   The resulting search results include a record for the primary object (the whole), along with records for the component objects (the parts).\nObject types (part/whole) are indicated by an icon overlaid on the thumbnail.\n(See blog post for more on Cleveland’s search.)\nEach object page of a complex object includes a note and link: “Part of a set. See all set records” (See screenshot) The link initiates a search for the accession number, with an option set to “include object parts.” The resulting search results page shows all component objects along with the cover (complete) object.\nUnfortunately, the Cleveland implementation doesn’t offer a way to view component objects together as a whole. There is no page-turning image viewer for the 15th-century French book of hours, for instance.\n       Expand   Qatar Digital Library        Expand          Expand          Expand   The new Qatar Digital Library (built by Cogapp) includes full-featured accommodations for complex objects.\nSearch results include cover objects (whole objects) as well as component objects (pages), presented as mini-thumbnails. (Rollover a mini-thumbnail for a larger view.) Search terms are highlighted, and if the search term is found in a component page, that is noted.\nCover objects have a summary page with a unique layout, and the capability to search just the object’s component pages. (See example)\nComponent pages are primarily visual, with a robust IIIF viewer, including a side-by-side page view in a universal viewer. (See example)\nCogapp has a good blog post on the thinking behind Qatar Digital Library.\nThe Walters Ex Libris        Expand          Expand   The Walters has optimized the online presentation of their manuscript collection with a lovely custom IIIF viewer. There are no individual object pages for each manuscript page—each manuscript is presented as a whole, complete collection object, with a page-turning viewer as a main image. (See example)\nSearch results allow direct access to a view of individual component pages (within the manuscript viewer), along with options to download images directly. (See example)\nGetty Museum The Getty’s new collection online strives to show complex objects in context. Ideally, when you come upon an object that’s part of a whole, it’s easy to find other parts, and to see the whole. When you encounter an object with parts, you should have easy access to all the parts, and you should be given a good sense of the whole. (In the best case, that sense of the whole might be different depending on what kind of object you’re seeing.) The connections between parts and whole are key.\nSome broad requirements help put these ideas into action for collection online:\n A search option can be activated to include object parts in search returns (returns include only parent records by default.) Search returns are labeled “has parts” or “part of…” for easy identification. Object pages for parent records include a section with images and links to its parts.  If the parent object is composed of fragments, then show a text link to each child record. Individual fragments rarely have their own image. If the parent object is book-like, show the pages/parts together in a 2-up side-by-side book view   Object pages for child records show and link to the parent record, as well as to other parts  Complex objects in Getty’s collection are now presented with valuable context, restoring some of the quirky and strange relationships between objects. The broad requirements can’t cover every situation; there are inconsistencies, and “edge cases” abound in museum collections. (This is to be celebrated! It’s part of what makes museum objects special.) Take for example the “Poet as Orpheus with Two Sirens,” a nearly life-size sculptural ensemble featuring a male figure (with feet resting on a detached footstool and base—each separately accessioned), and two elegant female figures…accompanied by 304 (!) fragmentary curls. Each part and fragment has its own entry, description and history, but each is also connected and contextualized as parts of a greater whole.\n","id":6,"length":895,"title":"6. Complex Objects","type":"essay","url":"/essay-complex/"},{"content":"Collection data is the lifeblood of a museum’s online collection. The web is a presentation layer—and a brilliant one at that—but it is just one expression of the collection data that flows behind it. The collection data itself has a history: often starting as a personal inventory, with object notations written longhand in a ledger, then copied, perhaps transcribed onto index cards, then into a database, then migrated to a new database, and so on. Along the way, the data changes, with new information added, fixed, deleted, for different uses and applications, by people with different personalities (and perspectives and biases). Collection data is never complete and never finished; there’s always more to know and more to say about collections. Likewise, data formats and structures change; while there is no way to perfectly represent an object in data, there are ways that are more flexible, usable and shareable.\nGetty is a trailblazer when it comes to collection data. Its research and scholarship, shared standards and resources, innovative data infrastructure, open images and data, all come together in the new collection online:\nResearch and Scholarship Getty’s collection online showcases the organization’s collection knowledge and research. Scholarship is a high priority for the institution, and each object page strives to be a compendium of all the Getty knows about an object. Deep collection knowledge, coupled with thoughtful attention to how that knowledge is structured and kept, allows Getty’s new collection online to do things few other online collections can manage.\n The Provenance section shows how research and structure open new avenues for exploration. Getty, of course, is home to the Getty Provenance Index and other resources; it’s a leader for the field in provenance research—tracing the ownership of collection objects through time. Object pages reflect this rich knowledge in a robust object history. Moreover, the provenance section is not just free text, or a single styled block of HTML. Each owner has a separate entry, with structured fields for dates (display dates shown, with machine-readable dates behind the scenes), notes and citations. Constituent names are linked to pages that show every work of art in the collection associated with that person. Exhibition entries show title, location and dates; titles link to an Exhibition page that features related objects (sometimes over multiple locations), as well as descriptive text, and links to exhibition websites and resources, when available. Publications link to the publication, when possible. For objects that are on view, the location links to a Gallery page that shows all works of art in the gallery, along with a map and descriptive text, when available.  The collection online aims for comprehensive, authoritative information, structured thoughtfully, and presented in a way that fosters usability and exploration.\nData for discovery and social sharing Collection data is also woven into the HTML itself to make the collection pages more discoverable and shareable. Object pages include Schema.org markup that lets Google (and other search engines) know exactly what the page contains. (The data is delivered as JSON-LD within the head section of the HTML.) Google uses this structured data for the rich results seen on search returns, and this markup also helps power voice assistants, like Siri, Alexa and Google Assistant. Similarly, OpenGraph tags are included in every object page to make sure that collection objects are well represented (with thumbnails, title, etc.) when shared on Facebook, Twitter and beyond.\nTip: Look in the head section when you inspect the source HTML of an object page to find the structured markup.\nIIIF The new collection online manages, displays and shares images using IIIF, an open standard for delivering digital resources. IIIF is perhaps best known for enabling audiences to zoom in to explore high resolution images, and Getty’s online collection certainly takes advantage of this capability for open-access images. The image viewer also allows for side-by-side presentations, handy for books and manuscripts. IIIF goes deeper than the presentation layer, though; Getty uses IIIF APIs to serve all collection images on collection online. The API is available for others to use as well, so Getty collection images can be shared, explored, and compared with IIIF images from other collections.\nTip: Check out the link to the IIIF manifest in the pulldown menu under the main image, and in the Technical Metadata section at the bottom of the page. To explore the object in a full-featured image viewer, click the link to “Open in comparison viewer.”\nVocabularies Getty uses controlled vocabularies throughout its collection data. (This won’t come as a surprise, of course, as several of the most prominent vocabularies for art museums—ULAN, AAT, TGN—are administered by Getty Research Institute.) Using the vocabularies helps core systems disambiguate people, places and terms. It also can allow the collection online to tap into information from a shared authority, like artist’s birth and death dates, etc.\nTip: Check out the link to the ULAN record on artist pages in collection online.\nMultiple interfaces This robust data backend opens up Getty’s deep collection knowledge, including rich context and stories. The data infrastructure supports many possible views into the collection. Researchers with detailed, complex questions can query the data directly, using a SPARQL endpoint. (SPARQL is also available in a helpful web application.) This expert access relieves some pressure on the collection online, allowing it to focus on a broader audience. Additional experimental interfaces are already on the drawing board. Data and infrastructure allows for a range of collection applications, tailored for audience needs.\nLinked Art Getty’s online collection lives and breathes Linked Art, a new shared data model for describing museum collections. The Getty infrastructure feeds Linked Art data to internal systems—including the collection online—and to a public API. Every object page draws its content from a Linked Art data file (in JSON-LD) and presents it in the browser. Making Linked Art a core part of the infrastructure means the collection data and related services will always be central for Getty: maintained, tested, and available. If the Linked Art data infrastructure fails, the collection online (along with all other collection applications) will go offline as well.\n(Getty’s Research Collection Viewer blazed a trail for the Collection Online’s data, systems and infrastructure. For a deep dive on Getty’s Linked Art infrastructure, see\nhttps://mw21.museweb.net/paper/building-linked-open-data-web-applications-from-the-outside-in-lessons-learned-from-building-the-gettys-research-collections-viewer/ )\nTip: Find a link to the object’s Linked.art JSON-LD in the Technical Metadata section at the bottom of the page.\nUsing Linked Art opens the door for shared opportunities and collaboration. Getty isn’t the first museum to power its online collection with a public API, but it is one of the first to implement Linked Art at scale. What might this mean for museums?\n Common apps: With a standard data model, an application that’s made to work with one museum’s collection data can easily use data from another museum. (eg. Collection pages built to work with one collection API can be repurposed for another.) Shared tooling: Application logic and code can also be shared when there’s a shared data model. For instance, Getty has developed linkedart.js, a javascript library that simplifies the process of presenting Linked Art data on a web page or other media. Aggregation: It’s easier to bring together many collections when they share a data structure. Model for others: It’s hard to be on the cutting edge (especially for cultural organizations.) Museums—especially art museums—looking to build collection APIs and online collections can look to Getty as an example.  Getty’s commitment to linked data holds promise for the museum sector as a whole. In many ways, the notion of linking collections has been the Holy Grail of museum technology. After all, many of the most interesting collection-related questions can only be answered by looking across collections. This ideal, however, requires a shared language and a shared medium. Until recently, museums have been content to tend their walled gardens of data. Getty has put the pieces in place to open the gardens: Linked.art provides a common model for describing collections, a shared language. Vocabularies establish shared authorities, so we know that one museum’s “Vincent van Gogh” is the same person as another’s “Vincent Willem van Gogh.” IIIF provides a standard for sharing images. Schema.org and OpenGraph standards encourage sharing on the web and through social networks. Getty has put the pieces in place to share its collection, and moreover, is dedicated to sharing its resources and know-how as well. As more and more museums do likewise, the long-term dividends of connected collections may be substantial.\n","id":7,"length":1406,"title":"7.
